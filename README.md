# Intro-stat-demo
This repo highlights some of the concepts in elementary or advanced statistics. The topics covered are generally taught in my undergraduate or master study. They are originally parts of my notes for consolidation of related knowledge. After a consideration, I decided to refine some of the notes and publish here. Compared with my original notes, the materials here are coupled with more visually appealing graphs and readable paragraph. This repo also serves as an exercise for article writing, data visualisation and LaTex formatting. I will update the repo irregularly. 

Topics Covered:
1. Probability Mass Function and Probability Distribution Function of Discrete Random Variable


_The materials are in preliminary version so it may be subject to errors. If you encounter any errors in my materials, feel free to report them to me._
